<h1>The Best Movies according to Ian </h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Guardians of the galaxy</h3>

<p>The reason why I absolutely love this film is because 
    it is based on a group of people, that works to reflect a 
    dysfunctional family, with an amazing soundtrack that will 
    be unforgettable, James Gunn absolutely smashed it out of the 
    park with this movie
</p>

<h3>Twisters</h3>

<p>Tornados, lots of them, country music and beer, what else could 
    you want from a film </p>

<h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>

<p>This is more than a movie, it gives beautiful life lessons, 
    Matt Damon and Robin Williams are a perfect duo. I would 
recommend this just for the one line 'I am going to see about a girl' </p>
