<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Ian! I’m a dedicated computer science MSc student at the 
  University of York with a deep passion for technology, law, and innovative 
  problem-solving. With a foundation in programming and web development (Java, 
  Python, SQL, React, and more), I strive to create efficient and meaningful solutions. 
  My legal background, particularly in AI and space law, gives me a unique lens through 
  which I approach technology, ensuring a thoughtful balance between innovation and regulation.</p>

<p>Outside of academics, I lead the Climbing and Mountaineering Society and have had the 
  privilege of speaking at events like the Sirius Space Talks. I’m always eager to expand 
  my network, learn from industry experts, and grow my skills. Whether tackling coding 
  challenges or exploring the latest tech advancements, I’m passionate about building 
  a meaningful impact through technology.</p>
